# Console Log to Workspace

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/deekayen/jenkins-log-console-log/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is a Jenkins plug-in that allows you to save the console log to a file in the
build's workspace for further processing.

One of its uses is to allow post-processing tools such as log analyzers that
only reads files to do its work.
